"""Persistence of calibrations as a small, human-readable JSON file.

Only numbers are stored: the feature vectors (head pose angles, head position,
iris offsets), the screen points they were labelled with and the fitted model.
Camera frames are never part of a calibration.

A calibration is only valid for the setup it was recorded on: the monitor
layout, the vision backend (and the version of its measurements) and the
camera. A laptop that moves between desks therefore needs one calibration per
desk, so the file holds a small :class:`CalibrationLibrary` of *profiles*, one
per setup, most recently used first. Version 1 files, which held a single
calibration, are read as a library with one profile.

The file is pretty-printed with one sample per line so it stays readable and
reasonably small (a two-monitor calibration is roughly 50 KB). Loading never
raises: a missing, unreadable, corrupt or too new file yields an empty library
(``None`` from :func:`load_calibration`) and the app asks for a new calibration;
a single corrupt profile is skipped and the others are kept.
