#: Modifiers of the default hotkeys by ``sys.platform``; the keys are T (pause /
#: resume tracking), P (privacy mode) and C (calibrate) everywhere. A global hotkey
#: takes its combination away from every other application, so the defaults must
#: type no character, stay pressable while a keyboard-layout switch is configured,
#: and be no default shortcut of the system or of the tools this app's users are
#: likely to run. Ctrl+Alt+Meta (Ctrl+Alt+Win, ⌃⌥⌘, Ctrl+Alt+Super) passes on
#: every platform; what was checked:
#:
#: * Windows reports AltGr as Ctrl+Alt, and the layout tables of the stock Windows
#:   layouts show Ctrl+Alt(+Shift)+T, P and C typing characters on 19-47 layouts each
#:   (Ctrl+Alt+T is '₺' on Turkish Q, Ctrl+Alt+C 'ć' on Polish (Programmers),
#:   Ctrl+Alt+P 'ö' on US-International). No Windows layout uses the Win key as a
#:   character modifier, and the shell's own Win shortcuts (Game Bar Win+Alt+*,
#:   Win+Ctrl+*, the Office key Ctrl+Alt+Shift+Win) leave Ctrl+Alt+Win+T/P/C free.
#: * Linux (X11): AltGr is a modifier of its own (Mod5), so Ctrl+Alt chords never
#:   type. GNOME, KDE Plasma, Xfce, Cinnamon and MATE open a terminal on Ctrl+Alt+T,
#:   switch virtual terminals on Ctrl+Alt+F1-F12 and bind Super+letter (Super+P:
#:   displays), but none binds Ctrl+Alt+Super+T, P or C, and X grabs match the
#:   modifiers exactly, so Super+P is not Ctrl+Alt+Super+P. Ctrl+Alt+Shift, the
#:   default of earlier builds, failed twice. With the XKB layout switches that
#:   bilingual users pick most, Alt+Shift (grp:alt_shift_toggle) and Ctrl+Shift
#:   (grp:ctrl_shift_toggle), whichever of the pair is pressed second switches the
#:   layout instead of adding its modifier (xkeyboard-config symbols/group), so the
#:   chord cannot be formed and arrives as Ctrl+Alt+T (a terminal) or Ctrl+Shift+T.
#:   And IDEs use it: the JetBrains keymap for Refactor This, Copy Reference and
#:   Introduce Functional Parameter (Ctrl+Alt+Shift+T/C/P), VS Code for Copy Path
#:   (Ctrl+Alt+Shift+C). Neither binds Ctrl+Alt+Super. The other usual switches
#:   (Super+Space, Caps Lock, Shift+Caps Lock) leave the defaults alone; the rare
#:   options that do (grp:ctrl_alt_toggle, the Win-key switches and selectors,
#:   altwin:ctrl_win, ...) are detected by the hotkey manager, which then reports
#:   the hotkey as unavailable instead of grabbing a chord that cannot be pressed.
#:   One limit remains where a desktop binds Super on its own (Xubuntu's menu):
#:   its grab takes the keyboard while Super is held, so the chord works only
#:   with Ctrl or Alt pressed first. The hotkey manager detects that and says so.
#: * macOS: Control+Option+Command+letter types nothing. Rectangle and Magnet, the
#:   window managers multi-monitor Mac users run most, take ⌃⌥ with arrows and
#:   letters by default (⌃⌥T Last Two Thirds, ⌃⌥C Center) and ⌃⌥⌘ only with ←/→
#:   (previous / next display); Rectangle's Spectacle scheme uses ⌥⌘ (⌥⌘C Center).
#:   Moom and BetterTouchTool use only the shortcuts their user records. macOS binds
#:   no ⌃⌥⌘+letter (VoiceOver, while it runs, reads every ⌃⌥ chord as a command of
#:   its own). Hotkeys are registered exclusively, so a combination that another
#:   app already holds is reported ("Hotkey unavailable: ⌃⌥⌘T is already in use by
#:   another application") instead of firing in both apps.
#:
#: The table stays per platform so that one platform's defaults can change without
#: touching the others; :data:`LEGACY_HOTKEYS` and :data:`LEGACY_HOTKEYS_X11` list
#: what earlier builds used, and :func:`_migrate` moves untouched old files over.
