"""The orchestrator: camera, gaze model, decision engine and OS actions wired together.

:class:`Controller` lives on the Qt main thread and owns every moving part:

* a vision worker (camera + face analysis on a background thread),
* the gaze model from the calibration, smoothed by a One Euro filter,
* the pure decision engine (:mod:`.decision`, :mod:`.presence`, :mod:`.guard`,
  :mod:`.scheduler`, :mod:`.input_state`, :mod:`.window_memory`,
  :mod:`.camera_yield`),
* the platform services that move the cursor, focus windows and lock the screen,
* global hotkeys.

Threading
---------
Worker and hotkey callbacks arrive on foreign threads. They are marshalled to
the main thread through private queued signals; a callback that already runs on
the main thread is handled directly. Locking the screen can block for seconds,
so it runs on a short-lived thread whose result comes back the same way; so do
the split-pane providers, on the pane worker's thread (:mod:`eye_tracker.panes`).
Everything else runs on the main thread,
so no locking is needed beyond the hand-off of preview frames and the record of
the backend the worker built.

State
-----
The public :class:`~eye_tracker.types.TrackingState` is *derived* from a small
set of independent flags (user pause, privacy mode, session locked, camera
yielded, user away, camera error, calibrating, calibration valid), in this
priority order::

    PRIVACY > LOCKED > CALIBRATING > PAUSED > YIELDED > AWAY > CAMERA_ERROR
            > NEEDS_CALIBRATION > TRACKING

Deriving instead of transitioning means overlapping causes (paused *and* the
session locked, say) resolve naturally when one of them ends. Whether the camera
is open follows directly from the state (``TrackingState.camera_active``).
Before the camera reopens after a pause, privacy mode or a locked session, the
"another app uses the camera" check runs first, so a call that started
meanwhile never has its camera grabbed.

Calibrations
------------
The calibration file holds one profile per setup (monitor layout, vision
backend, camera; see :class:`~eye_tracker.gaze.store.CalibrationLibrary`). The
controller uses the profile that fits the current setup and switches profiles
by itself when the setup changes (a laptop moving between docks), so a
recalibration is only needed for a setup that was never calibrated. When the
calibration becomes unusable ``calibration_required`` is emitted; if the user
cannot be interrupted at that moment (away, locked, privacy mode, displays off)
the announcement is delivered once they are back and the monitor layout has
settled.

Split panes (experimental)
--------------------------
With ``panes.enabled`` the focused window is followed as well: its application
is identified, its panes are asked for (once when it gets focus, then about
every :data:`PANE_REFRESH_S` while the gaze is inside it) and, while the monitor
decider finds the gaze on the cursor's monitor, :class:`~eye_tracker.panes.decider.PaneDecider`
decides when the keyboard focus moves to another pane. That asks the terminal
to focus the pane; no window is activated. Once it reports success the cursor
follows into the pane (``panes.move_cursor``), through the same announced warp
as a monitor switch. Pane focus waits ``panes.after_monitor_switch_ms`` after a
monitor switch.

Unreliable pointer position
---------------------------
On Wayland the pointer position Qt reports can be stale (an XWayland client
only sees the pointer over X11 windows). There the monitor the pointer is on is
taken to be the target of the last successful switch, and nothing is learned
from the pointer position (manual moves, implicit labels, undone switches).

Housekeeping
------------
A ``QTimer`` ticks every 100 ms while tracking (cursor polling resolution for the
mouse/typing guards) and every 500 ms otherwise. Each tick polls input, records
the focused window per monitor, checks for a locked session and for other apps
wanting the camera (on slower schedules), advances the walk-away timers, adapts
the camera frame rate, delivers deferred calibration announcements and
publishes statistics.
