"""The tray application: startup sequence, single instance and window management.

:func:`run_app` is what ``eye-tracker`` (``run``) executes. It is split into
:func:`build_app`, which creates everything, and :meth:`AppContext.exec`, which
runs the Qt event loop, so tests can build the whole app without entering the
loop. The startup order matters:

1. logging (console only for now), so native libraries are quietened before
   they load;
2. ``PlatformServices.prepare_process`` before the ``QApplication`` exists
   (DPI awareness and Qt environment variables), then the ``QApplication``;
3. the single-instance check: whoever takes the :class:`~eye_tracker.ipc.InstanceLock`
   is the instance. Otherwise (or if an older version answers) the running app
   is asked to show itself (or to calibrate; a login start only checks that it
   answers) and this process exits without touching the log file or the
   settings. An instance that is shutting down no longer answers but still
   holds the lock for a moment: the launch waits for it to exit and then
   becomes the instance;
4. file logging, settings, the command socket, the
   :class:`~eye_tracker.engine.controller.Controller` and the UI; once the
   event loop runs, the login item is pointed at this copy if it moved.

A process started at login (``--background``) stays quiet for
:data:`STARTUP_QUIET_S`. If the first-run setup was never finished, it then
offers the setup assistant with a notification, and a second launch (or
``ctl show``) opens the assistant.

:class:`EyeTrackerApp` owns the controller and every window. The windows talk to
the controller themselves (the tray, the gaze overlay, the countdown toast and
the privacy curtain follow its signals on their own); this class opens windows
on request (tray menu, IPC, hotkeys) and keeps at most one of each.
