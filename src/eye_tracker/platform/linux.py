"""Linux integration for X11 and Wayland sessions.

Design
------
Linux has no single desktop API, so every feature is a short list of
strategies tried in order, gated by what the session actually offers:

* **X11** gets the full feature set in-process: idle time from the
  MIT-SCREEN-SAVER extension (``libXss`` through ``ctypes``), window focus
  through EWMH and display power through the DPMS extension (both with
  ``python-xlib``), cursor warping through Qt.
* **Wayland** forbids global window inspection and pointer warping by design.
  The app still runs (Qt prefers XWayland so calibration windows can be
  positioned), presence and screen locking work through logind and
  desktop-specific tools, the cursor moves through the compositor's own IPC
  (sway, Hyprland) or ``ydotool``, and window focus is reported as unsupported.

Queries that are polled (idle time, lock state) go through D-Bus in-process
(QtDBus) once a Qt application exists, and fall back to ``gdbus``/``loginctl``.
Desktop tools are run with ``subprocess`` - never through a shell - and a short
timeout. Everything polled is cached so a busy tick never turns into a stream
of process launches, and the camera-in-use scan runs on a background thread.

Lock detection
--------------
logind's ``LockedHint`` is only set by lockers that report it (GNOME Shell,
KDE, light-locker ...). Tiling-WM lockers (swaylock, i3lock via xss-lock,
hyprlock, slock ...) never do, so a running locker process of this user's
login counts as "locked" as well (setuid lockers such as slock included, see
:meth:`LinuxPlatform._locker_running`), and ``loginctl lock-session`` only
counts as a successful lock when something reacted to it (see
:meth:`LinuxPlatform.lock_screen`). Tiling compositors that pose as GNOME or
KDE through ``XDG_CURRENT_DESKTOP`` are recognised by their IPC sockets.

Camera use by other apps
------------------------
A background thread looks for processes holding a physical ``/dev/video*``
node (``/proc/<pid>/fd``). With fanotify (unprivileged since Linux 5.13) it is
woken by every open and close of a camera node and can tell our own from other
processes'. V4L2 lets only one process stream, so another app that opens the
camera read-write while we stream and closes it again at once (a browser
joining a call gets EBUSY) was refused; the camera is then reported busy for a
grace period so that app can retry. With inotify only
(no process attribution) holders are still found as soon as they open the
device; without either, the scan is polled. Apps that capture through
PipeWire's camera portal never open the node themselves and cannot be seen;
``pause_for_apps`` covers those.

Cursor on Wayland
-----------------
``ydotool`` (1.x, with ``ydotoold`` running) moves the pointer through a
virtual uinput mouse. Its "absolute" move is emulated with relative motion,
so the compositor's pointer acceleration distorts it unless the acceleration
profile is flat. The injected motion also resets GNOME's idle timer; such
resets are recognised and not reported as user input.

The module imports on every OS (the test suite imports it on Windows and
macOS): ``python-xlib``, QtDBus and the X libraries are loaded lazily, and
every public method degrades to ``None``/``False`` instead of raising.
