Every method is *best effort*: implementations must never raise for an
unsupported operation. They return ``False``/``None`` instead and log at DEBUG
level, so the rest of the application can degrade gracefully (for example on a
Wayland session, where cursor warping is not allowed).

Thread-safety: all methods may be called from the Qt main thread. Methods
marked *any thread* may additionally be called from worker threads.
